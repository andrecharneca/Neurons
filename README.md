Machine Learning should be accessible for everyone, including users with no programming experience. That's why __Neurons__ was created.
__Neurons__ is a user interface for creating, training and testing Sequential models with Dense layers with the [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) packages.

## Installation

For Windows: download the Neurons program from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QSyN1-0nYQkK14U4Tzg9pFTQP2x6oX0m&export=download). Extract the zip folder. Inside the 'Neurons1.0' folder, find 'Neurons.exe' and double click.

## Features
Some of the main features in __Neurons__ include:
* Saving and loading models (in .h5 files).
* Adding, removing and editing layers.
* Compiling and fitting (training) model with specific settings.
* Predicted vs True Output, Model Loss vs Epoch and Metric  (e.g. accuracy, mean squared error, etc.) vs Epoch plots for performance evaluation.
* Evaluate (testing) or predict with model with specified dataset. Print outputs to file.
* Light and dark modes.


## Built With
Free packages __Neurons__ is mainly based on:
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [PyQt](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)
* [Qt-Material](https://pypi.org/project/qt-material/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
